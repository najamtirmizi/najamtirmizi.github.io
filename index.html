                    <li>
                        You’re overflowing with <span class="i">ideas—</span><br/>
                        but your <span class="i">systems</span> float away, caught in the current.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You’re <span class="i">doing</span> too much—<br/>
                        but without enough <span class="i">clarity.</span>

                        <span class="i">You</span> know your worth—<br/>

                        You see your <span class="i">peers</span> forging ahead with AI and tech—<br/>
                        but <span class="i">you’re</span> not sure how to navigate this new terrain.
                    </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            If that sounds familiar, <br/>
            you might be <span class="i">exactly</span> who I’m here for.
            </p>

            <h2>😩 Overwhelmed</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="i">You’re juggling too much, and nothing feels finished.</span> <br/>
                You don’t need more motivation—you need clarity, rhythm, and relief.
            </p>

            <h2>😵 Doing everything yourself</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="i">You’re the planner, doer, editor, marketer, and cleaner-upper.</span> <br/>
                And the systems you’ve built can’t scale without you.
            </p>
            
            <h2>🤐 Voice doesn’t sound like you</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="i">Your website, bio, or social posts don’t reflect your energy.</span> <br/>
                You’re showing up—but somehow, people still misread you.
            </p>
            
            <h2>🤔 Stuck pre-launch</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="i">You’re sitting on something powerful, but the “last mile” is a brick wall.</span> <br/>
                You keep rethinking, redesigning, or waiting for perfect.
            </p>
            
            <h2>😵‍💫 Systems in a mess after growth</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="i">Things took off faster than you expected—and now they’re tangled.</span> <br/>
                Processes that worked at 1x speed are cracking at 3x.

            <h1>Hi! I’m Najam:</h1>

            <img src="intro.webp" alt="Najam Tirmizi, headshot" class="headshot" />
            
            <p>
                Most of my life, I tried to fit in—<br/>
                <span class="b">not anymore.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve never matched a job description because I’m not a specialist—<br/>
                <span class="b">I’m a generalist by choice.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                I straddle tech, systems thinking, visual design, creative writing, AI, poetry, marketing, and more—<br/>
                <span class="b">too confusing for the average hiring manager.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                And if that’s your story too—if you feel unboxable, misjudged, or chronically misunderstood—<br/>
                <span class="b">I’m your guy.</span>

            <h1>Modeling <span class="i">your</span> weird—and making it <span class="i">work</span></h1>
            <p>
                We’re not just optimizing a workflow—<span class="b">we’re unearthing your <span class="i">genius.</span></span> <br/>
                Organizing your chaos. Giving you systems that breathe.
            </p>
            <p>
            I’ll help you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                spot which ideas are viable—<br/>
                and which ones need pruning
                </li>
                <li>
                build clarity into messy, high-stakes processes
                </li>
                <li>
                create systems that scale you—<br/>
                without turning you into a robot
                </li>
                <li>
                decide when (and if) to use generative AI<br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                choose free tools when they work better than fancy ones
                </li>
                <li>
                know when to act—<br/>
                and when to pause
                </li>
                <li>
                avoid getting scammed by AI snake oil
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Sometimes what you need isn’t AI at all: <br/>
                Maybe it’s a form. Maybe it’s a checklist. <br/>
                Maybe it’s a single, brave conversation.
